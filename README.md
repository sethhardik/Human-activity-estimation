In Preprocessing of data rather than using multiple values I too mean, variance, max and min of the X,Y and Z co-ordinates 

I have implemented the problem in three different ways 
      
      1. using only watch data 
      2. using only phone data 
      3. using both watch and mobile data
      
The max accuracy using machine learning model  is `66%` and it was achieved using only watch data for the models 

and the max accuracy obtained using deep learing model is `95%` again on watch dataset and for combined accuracy is `92%`

I tried many machine learning models and used only the most Accurate model for the final code file.

clearly deep learning model performed much better compared to deep learning model

The folder named `model and weights for neural network` contains `.h5` file having weights and `.json` file having model in them while using you need both the files.
