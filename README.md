# Prithvi-AI-assignment

In Preprocessing of data rather than using multiple values I too mean, variance, max and min of the X,Y and Z co-ordinates 

I have implemented the problem in three different ways 
      1. using only watch data 
      2. using only phone data 
      3. using both watch and mobile data
      
The max accuracy obtained is `66%` and it was achieved using only wacth data for the models 

I tried many machine learning models and used only the most Accurate model for the final code file.
